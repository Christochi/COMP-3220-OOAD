-Reverse engineering means the generation of diagrams from code

-I used easyUML. It is a Netbeans IDE Plugin. 

-I was able using this tool to reverse engineer the generated java files back to UML 
 class diagram

-Initially when forward engineered my class diagram to code, I got some error in the 
 code but like any good IDE, Netbeans made some recommendation. I implemented the
 recommendations in order to clear the errors in the code. 

-I reversed engineered to get this new UML Class Diagram

-The first class diagram is so different form the second class diagram. The 2 class diagrams
 don't look alike. There are more relationships among classes. 

  Game has a composition relationship with Player
  Board has a composition relationship with Player and Game
  Player, HumanPlayer and AI Player has a dependence relationship with Board
