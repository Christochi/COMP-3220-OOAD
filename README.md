Activity 1: Why did software developers steer away from the Waterfall lifecycle? are we saying 
that Agile is always better than waterfall or are there instances when Waterfall is better
and should be used instead of Agile?

Activity 2: Read the 4 Agile Manifesto values and the 12 principles behind the Agile Manifesto,
then review the "Artifacts of Inception" in Chapter 4 slide 8.

Agile values.
