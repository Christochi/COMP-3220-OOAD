Q1- Why did software developers steer away from the Waterfall lifecycle? are we saying 
that Agile is always better than waterfall or are there instances when Waterfall is better
and should be used instead of Agile?

Answer:
----------
Despite the fact that waterfall is slowly phasing out, it still has its usefulness depending on
the conditions and situation. They are:
- Waterfall is best suited for projects and teams that have a time frame for execution of each stage [1]
- It is befitting for small teams and as well as, small projects with easy defined deliverables [2]. These small 
  projects usually have predictable outcomes 
- For projects whose goals have been defined since inception. These goals are unchanging and they don't have room
  for client feedback
- If your project needs a structure to explain how far the project has progressed and its current status, 
  waterfall will suit this type of project. Whenever a stage has been completed, it means that the activities and
  requirements have been accomplished [3]. Stakeholders would be interested in knowing the current status of the project

Software developers and project managers have realized waterfall has pitfalls and they are porting to other methodologies
like agile to improve timing, communication among teams and stakeholders, room for amendment and testing. 
- Feedback from client can often be too late during the project cycle [1]. Going back to a previous stage to include a requirement
  (client feedback) can be time consuming and incurs more cost
- Waterfall pushes software testing towards the end of the development cycle [1]. This encourages codes that are disjointed,
  poorly written and unmaintainable. A single error can cause a change which can leads to days. If frequent testing is required,
  agile will be suitable. 
- It is team focussed. It excludes client or end users (stakeholders). It focuses on helping teams move more efficiently through
  the phases of the project [2]. Clients are stakeholders so they always want to be involved.

In my opinon, one method isn't better than the other. Depending on the situation, one method will flourish more than the other.
At times different methodologies should be combined.

Q2- If we do a search today for jobs related to software development, analysis or design. These are aspects in software engineering that 
are critical for the software development industry. Search for a job posting on the Internet (e.g. monster.ca or dice.com or other job sites) 
for positions in these fields and identify what tools/technologies/techniques the industry is asking for that relate to the methodologies we are studying? 
e.g. look for things like: XP, Scrum, Agile, Waterfall, Analysis tools, Design Tools, UML, etc...

Answer:
------------
I have job positions that require strong grounding and years of experience of using techniques like agile, XP, scrum. Some of the job titles are:
Agile Coach, Scrum Master, Software Project Manager, Business Analyst, etc. The links are below:
